## Introduction

Welcome to the **Little Lemon Frontend** project! This project is a hands-on learning experience designed to help me master front-end development skills as part of the **Meta Front-End Software Developer Certificate** offered by Meta on Coursera. The main goal is to build a responsive and visually appealing web application using modern front-end technologies.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS for rapid and efficient styling.
- **ReactJS Framework:** Leverages the power of ReactJS for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Clean and Modern UI:** Focuses on a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing design.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed with future enhancements and scalability in mind.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Modern JavaScript features for enhanced functionality.
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** Standard markup and styling languages.
- **Git & GitHub:** Version control and repository hosting.
- **Node.js & npm:** JavaScript runtime and package manager.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js:** [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm:** Comes bundled with Node.js
- **Git:** [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ngmtri20901/MetaSoftwareCert.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd MetaSoftwareCert/front-end
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will automatically open in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can explore and interact with the application. Here are some key functionalities:

- **Navigation:** Seamlessly navigate between different sections of the application.
- **Responsive Layout:** Test the application's responsiveness by resizing your browser window or using device simulation tools.
- **Styling:** Observe how Tailwind CSS classes are used to style components efficiently.
- **Component Structure:** Explore the ReactJS component hierarchy and understand how components communicate.

## Future Enhancements

The **Little Lemon Frontend** project is an ongoing learning journey. Here are some planned future enhancements:

- **Backend Integration:** Connect the frontend with a backend server to handle data fetching, user authentication, and more.
- **State Management:** Implement state management solutions like Redux or Context API for better state handling.
- **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the application for faster load times and better performance.
- **Advanced Features:** Incorporate features like form validation, user profiles, and interactive elements.
